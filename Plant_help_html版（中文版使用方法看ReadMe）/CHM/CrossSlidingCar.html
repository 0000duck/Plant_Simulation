The <em> Transporter</em>, called <em> Vehicle</em> here, which transports the parts, is an integral part of the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> ( CSC). The <em> Vehicle</em> makes extensive use of the loading space of type <b class="uiTerm">Conveyor</b>. It designates an <b class="uiTerm"> active length-oriented loading space</b> similar to a conveyor being part of the loading space, which transports the loaded parts forwards or backwards.

         <p class="para_topic"> The figure above shows a typical case in which to use a <em> cross-sliding car</em>. Parts arrive from the left-hand side and are to be distributed to the conveyors on the right-hand side according to their attribute <em> Destination</em>. An arriving part registers in the order list of the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> by calling the method <em> partHere</em>. Within this method the part enters itself into the list of transport orders of the <em> cross-sliding car</em> by using the method <a class="links" href="id29102.html"> transportOrder</a>.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic"> The list of transport orders can contain several orders. If you do not enter a control <a class="links" href="id34244.html"> Strategy</a>, the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> processes the order list in the sequence in which orders were entered. 
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic"> When the order is processed, the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> first moves to the <em> Conveyor</em> at which it is to pick the part up. There it waits until the respective part is ready to leave. This way a transport order can be created before the part has reached the end of the <em> Conveyor</em>.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic"> As soon as the part has moved onto the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em>, it drives to the <em> target conveyor</em> of the part. As soon as it arrived there, the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> first waits for the duration of the damping time until the Vehicle has been completely steadied. Only then the transported part moves onto the <em> target conveyor</em>, which moves it on. After the part has completely left the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em>, it processes the next order.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">If there is no destination defined at the part, the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> uses the destination defined in the transport order. When loading several parts with different destinations, the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> first drives to the destination defined in the transport order, then to the destination defined in the parts loaded. 
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic"> The <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> can transport several parts. To make it do so, enter a value greater than 1 into the text box <b class="uiTerm">Capacity</b>. Note that the width of the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> has to be greater than or equal to the overall length of the parts to be loaded. If several parts are to be loaded, the parts can have different targets. The <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> then approaches the targets in the sequence in which the parts were loaded.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic"> To enter the branch conveyors to be serviced into the table of the <a class="links" href="id90707.html"> Open List of Attached Conveyors</a>, drag them onto the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> and drop them there. This also determines the position, left or right, of the conveyor in relation to the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em>. This is important because the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> has to determine the direction in which the transported part drives onto the loading space or off of the loading space, either backwards or forwards. This process also determines the target position to which the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> has to drive to load or unload the part respectively. During the initialization phase of the model <em> Plant Simulation</em> also creates the sensors at the computed positions. It offsets the positions of the sensors by half the width of the <em> cross-sliding car</em> so that the <em> Vehicle</em> is located at the correct position when the sensor is activated.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic"> When a component in the simulation model fails, the <em> Vehicle</em> stops immediately. It continues and finishes its transport order once the failure is repaired. 
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic"> The end of a shift does not directly affect the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em>. It indirectly affects the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> when no additional transport order is entered.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic"> Deleting the currently transported part cancels the current transport order. If the order list contains another order, the <em>CrossSlidingCar</em> processes this order. If no other order is waiting, theCrossSlidingCar stops until another order arrives.
