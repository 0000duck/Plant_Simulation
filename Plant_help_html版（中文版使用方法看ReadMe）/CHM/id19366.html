         <p class="para_topic">The <em>Broker</em> cooperates with the <a class="links" href="id93899.html">Exporter</a> and the <em>importers</em> (see <a class="links" href="id88367.html">Tab Importer</a> and <a class="links" href="id61082.html">Sub-tab Failure</a>) of the <em>Station</em>, the <em>ParallelStation</em>, the <em>AssemblyStation</em>, and the <em>DismantleStation</em>. 
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">The <em>Broker</em> is the go-between for services offered and services required. Each <em>Broker</em> can manage several <em>Exporters</em>, which tender services, and it may receive requests from several <em>importers</em> that require services. A request consists of a list of services and the amount of required services. A service name is a <em>string</em>. You might model the supervisor of an plant or the foreman of a shop with it.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">Once a <em>Broker</em> receives a request from an <em>importer</em>, it immediately attempts to fulfill it using the <em>Exporters</em> it manages. If the <em>Broker</em> does not succeed in doing this, it may also pass the request on to other <em>Brokers</em> it is connected to with a <em>Connector</em>. The direction of the <em>Connector</em> determines the direction in which <em>Plant Simulation</em> passes the request on. If the <em>Exporters</em> of different <em>Brokers</em> are able to satisfy the request, those <em>Exporter</em> are assigned. If the request cannot be satisfied immediately, the <em>Broker</em> that received it first will save it. 
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">The <em>Broker</em> then attempts to provide the service at a later point in time. To do this, he goes from requested service to requested service and attempts to find an <em>Exporter</em> for each. If an <em>Exporter</em> offers the service, it is going to reserve the maximum possible or the necessary number. Then the <em>Exporter</em> cannot offer this reserved amount of services for other services. For this reason we recommend to request special services first and more general ones last.

         <p class="para_topic">The <em>Broker</em> does not execute any optimization! That way it may happen that the <em>Broker</em> cannot assign any <em>Exporters</em>, although the <em>Exporters</em> may theoretically be assigned. 
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">The following example clarifies that: The <em>importer</em> named <em>MyImporter</em> requires one service A and B each. There are two <em>Exporters</em> with a capacity of 1 each. <em>Exporter1</em> exports services A and B, <em>Exporter2</em> only service A. Both <em>Exporters</em> are registered with the same <em>Broker</em>. If the <em>importer</em> named <em>MyImporter</em> requests the services in the order (A,B) then the <em>Broker</em> assigns <em>Exporter1</em> for service A and discovers that <em>Exporter2</em> cannot export the still missing service; thus it cannot fulfill the request. 
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">If the <em>importer</em> named <em>MyImporter</em> puts in the request in the order (B,A), it will be fulfilled immediately: <em>Exporter1</em> provides service B and <em>Exporter2</em> service A. The sequence in which a <em>Broker</em> passes requests on is defined in a unique way by the <em>Connectors</em>. The <em>Broker</em> first passes the request on to all of its direct successors, defined by the number of the <em> Connector</em>. After that it passes the request on to the successors of the successors. Once an <em>Exporter</em> registers with its <em>Broker</em> as being available, the <em>Broker</em> attempts to find new <em>importers</em> for the <em>Exporter</em>. First, the <em>Broker</em> checks the unsatisfied requests it manages and then it has its <em>Broker</em> successors check for any unsatisfied requests.
