                  <em>Part</em>, <em>Container</em> and <em>Transporter</em> represent the physical or logical parts moving through the model, i.e., your installation. These mobile objects (<em>MUs</em>) require active and passive material flow objects to process and transport them.

               <p class="para_item">The <em>Source</em> creates mobile objects at the beginning of the flow of materials through your plant. The <em>Drain</em> removes the <em>MUs</em> from the plant after the material flow objects have processed them.

                  <em>Source</em>, <em>Drain</em>, <em>Station</em>, <em>ParallelStation</em>, <em>AssemblyStation</em>, <em>DismantleStation</em>, <em>Conveyor</em>, <em>Sorter</em>, <em>PlaceBuffer</em>, and <em>Buffer</em> receive <em>MUs</em>, and process them for a certain time. They then attempt to <b class="uiTerm">actively transfer the MUs</b> to the next object along material flow connections, symbolized by the <em>Connector</em>, <b class="uiTerm">employing the push-block principle</b>. They represent work stations in a factory, such as a lathe or a drilling station, etc. They only differ in the number of <em>MUs</em> they can process at the same time, a single one or several, and in the way they process them, in series or in parallel. Basically, the <em>Conveyor</em> resembles a conveyor system transporting <em>MUs</em> it a given speed over a given distance.

                  <em>Store</em>, <em>Track</em> and <em>TwoLaneTrack</em> do not automatically transfer <em>MUs</em>. An <em>MU</em> remains in the <em>Store</em> until it is removed, for example by employing a <em>Method</em>. You can only use the <em>Track</em> and the <em>TwoLaneTrack</em> in a meaningful way in conjunction with the <em>Transporter</em>, which moves along the <em>Track</em> with the speed you set.
