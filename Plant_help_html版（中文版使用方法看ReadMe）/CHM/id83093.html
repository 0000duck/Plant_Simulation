            <img align="bottom" src="../graphics/nonLocalized/plant_sim_help/icons/icons/ViewerObjectGraphicGroup1.gif" border="0"> used to decorate the inside of the object. A graphic group can be permanently shown or hidden to enable switching between alternative visual representations. Each simulation object or animatable object contains at least one external graphic group named <b class="uiTerm">default</b> and optionally any number of alternative or additional graphic groups, which you can show or hide independent of each other. In addition a A <em>Frame</em> initially contains one internal graphic group named <b class="uiTerm">Deco</b>. The permanent visibility of the graphic groups is an object property which can be inherited as well as the entire graphic structure. You can create, delete, or replace graphic groups on the <a class="links" href="id24835.html">Tab Graphics</a> in the dialog <b class="uiTerm">Edit 3D Properties</b> and in the dialog <a class="links" href="id17815.html">Show 3D Graphic Structure</a>.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">The state group is named <b class="uiTerm">States</b> and consists of a set of state graphics which correspond to the LEDs in <em>Plant Simulation</em>2D. You can create, replace, or delete the state group on the <a class="links" href="id24835.html">Tab Graphics</a> in the dialog <b class="uiTerm">Edit 3D Properties</b> by selecting the orientation of the states for the state group: <b class="uiTerm">Horizontal</b>, <b class="uiTerm">Vertical</b>, or <b class="uiTerm">None</b>. When you change this setting, <em>3D</em> always deletes all state graphics and creates new state graphics afterwards, which are arranged according to your selection.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">You can delete and edit each graphic of a graphic group, a state group, or a state graphic individually. To modify a graphic you can either change it with the mouse in a 3D window or you can specify the new <b class="uiTerm">position</b>, the <b class="uiTerm">rotation</b>, the <b class="uiTerm">scaling</b>, or the <b class="uiTerm">material</b> in the dialog <b class="uiTerm">Edit 3D Properties</b> of the selected graphic.

When you change the graphics of a derived object, this only changes the object in which you make the changes because <em>3D</em> turns off graphic inheritance if it has not been turned off already. As deactivating graphic inheritance causes graphics to be duplicated, we strongly advise you to make changes in the class object as far as possible.
