         <p class="para_topic"><em>Genetic algorithms</em> are stochastic optimization procedures that in most cases only produce an approximate solution. For the most common practical applications these approximate solutions do suffice. <em>Genetic algorithms</em> manage several solution proposals during the optimization. According to evolution in biology these solution proposals are called <b class="uiTerm">individuals</b>. The individuals managed in a single optimization step are combined into a <b class="uiTerm">generation</b>. The quality of a solution proposal is evaluated through a numerical value, the so-called <b class="uiTerm">fitness value</b>.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">Solutions generated by <em>Genetic Algorithms</em> are passed to the simulation model, which in turn will be configured accordingly. When you do not use the Batch-Mean method, <em>Plant Simulation</em> starts the simulation run with the settings typical for this solution. At the end of the simulation run the simulation model is going to pass the resulting fitness value back to the object <em>GAWizard</em>.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">The Batch-Mean method starts a single simulation run for the entire optimization run. After a warm-up period, it uses time sectors for evaluating the solution. At the beginning of a time sector the method configures the model for a solution. At the end of the time sector the fitness value will be determined.</p>
         <p class="para_topic">When your evaluation takes place via a model containing random components, such as failures of machines, then you have to execute several simulation runs for each newly created individual. The fitness value is called observation. The genetic algorithm uses the mean value of all observations of the fitness values of an individual. Enter the number of observations per individual on the tab Define of the <em>GAWizard</em>. For a deterministic simulation, you will use a single observation per individual. 
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">When the genetic algorithm creates individuals defining the same parameterization, the <em>GAWizard</em> recognizes this and uses the fitness values of the already evaluated individuals. The optimization run thus does not waste additional time for multiple evaluations of an individual.
