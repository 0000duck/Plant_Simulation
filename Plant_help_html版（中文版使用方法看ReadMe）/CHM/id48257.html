         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">In general, operations research processes are intended to allow you to make the right decisions, qualitatively as well as quantitatively. They formulate optimization models, containing all relevant factors, such as destination function, conditions and destination description. These processes require large amounts of processing power the more detailed the model is. Besides, the results and acceptance of operations research processes often are not satisfactory.</p>
         <p class="para_topic">In addition to linear optimization models nowadays simulation is increasingly used for making the right decisions. It offers good solutions for complex problems but does not automatically create the actual optimum. This is justified by the comparatively low amount of mathematical expenditure to obtain that result. </p>
         <p class="para_topic">As processes to be analyzed become more complicated and complex and as more factors have to included, the more important simulation becomes with its analysis of real processes. These processes cannot be covered by mathematical solution processes or optimization processes or they may be realized only by using a large amount of resources. </p>
         <p class="para_topic">The aim of simulation is to arrive at objective decisions by dynamic analysis, to enable managers to safely plan and, in the end, to reduce cost. </p>
         <p class="para_topic">Thus, if real systems and plants are too expensive for conducting experiments and the time to conduct trials is too limited and too expensive, modeling, simulation and animation are excellent tools for analyzing and optimizing time dynamic processes. </p>
         <p class="para_topic">When creating your simulation models, you can use different modeling approaches:</p>
