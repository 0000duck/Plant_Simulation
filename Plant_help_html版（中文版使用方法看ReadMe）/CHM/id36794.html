      <div class="contentType_"><span id="ndxgenid_PlantSimulationENU_12748"></span><p class="para_topic"> The neural network consists of an input layer, one or two hidden layers and an output layer. The input layer is the number of input values of the simulation study. The output layer is the number of output values. For most applications a single hidden layer will suffice. The hidden layer is a special parameter of the neural network, which you can define. Enter different values and watch the results.</p>

         <p class="para_topic" align="center"><b class="uiTerm">Tri-layered neural network</b></p>
         <p class="para_topic">The graphic shows a tri-layered neural network with a four-dimensional input layer and a two-dimensional output layer. The hidden layer is five-dimensional. The input values are assigned to the nodes of the input layer. The output values are assigned to the nodes of the output layer. The hidden layer contains intermediate results of the calculation of the output values from the input values. Theoretical examinations of the learning algorithms have shown that such a neural network can detect and learn any interrelation between the input values and the output values, when the hidden layer has a sufficiently large number of nodes. Is is not possible though to predict how many nodes and training steps are required to arrive at the desired accuracy level. We do not, on the other hand, want to model noise with the artificial neural network while evaluating simulation studies. The dimensioning of the artificial neural network will always be a compromise between a model, which is as lean or as exact as possible. The artificial neural network should model typical correlations between the input values and the output values in a network with as few nodes as possible. </p>
