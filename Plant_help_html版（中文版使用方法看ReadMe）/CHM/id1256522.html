         <p class="para_topic">The <em>Transporter</em>, which moves the parts (Lift), is a built-in object of the <em>Lifter</em>. The <em>Transporter</em> makes extensive use of the load bay of type <em>Conveyor</em>. This is a length-oriented loading space similar to a Conveyor. For this reason the library provides active <em>Transporters</em> (<em>Hanger</em>), which drive on the <em>Electrical Overhead Monorail</em>.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">The class object of the <em>Transporters</em> is the object <em>Hanger</em> which is part of the library. If you want to use another object, always create a duplicate of the object Hanger and modify it to suit your needs. Do not modify the attributes defined in the object <em>Hanger</em> as this might lead to unexpected errors.

         <p class="para_topic"><em>EOM Transporters</em> arrive at the <em>Lifter</em>, which are to be lifted to the lower or upper level depending on the attribute <em>Destination</em> of the <em>Transporter</em>. An arriving part registers at the <em>Lifter</em> in the order list by calling the <b class="uiTerm">exit control</b> of the respective <em>Track</em>. In this exit control the part enters itself into the list of the transport orders of the <em>Lifter</em> by using the method <em>transportOrder</em>.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">This order list can contain several orders. If you did not enter a strategy control, the <em>Lifter</em> processes the order list in the chronological order in which the orders were registered.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">When an order is processed, the <em>Lift</em> of the <em>Lifter</em> first drives to the rail, at which it is to pick up the <em>Hanger</em>. There the <em>Lift</em> waits until the <em>Hanger</em> has driven onto the <em>Lift</em>. This facilitates creating a transport order before the <em>Hanger</em> arrived at the end of the rail.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">As soon as the <em>Hanger</em> has driven onto the <em>Lift</em>, the <em>Lift</em> drives to the destination rail. Once it arrives there, the transported <em>Hanger</em> drives onto the destination rail. After the <em>Hanger</em> has completely driven off the <em>Lift</em>, the <em>Lifter</em> processes the next order.

         <p class="para_topic">To enter the <b class="uiTerm">attached lines</b> (rails), which are to be serviced, into the table of the attached lines, drag them onto the <em>Lifter</em> and drop them there. <em>Plant Simulation</em> simultaneously calculates the Z position of the rail. The calculation also determines the position to which the <em>Lift</em> has to drive so that the transport rail has the correct position.
