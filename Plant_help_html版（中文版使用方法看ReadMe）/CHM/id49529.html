      <div class="contentType_"><span id="ndxgenid_PlantSimulationENU_235"></span><p class="para_topic">VDI (Verein Deutscher Ingenieure, Association of German Engineers) Directive 3633 defines simulation as the emulation of a system, including its dynamic processes, in a model one can experiment with. It aims at achieving results that can be transferred to a real world plant. In addition, simulation defines the preparation, execution and evaluation of carefully directed experiments within a simulation model. </p>
         <p class="para_topic">As a rule, you will execute a simulation study like this: </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               
               <p class="para_item">You first check out the real-world plant you want to model and collect the data you need for creating your simulation model. </p>
               
            </li>
            <li>
               
               <p class="para_item">You then abstract this real-world plant and create your simulation model according to the aims of the simulation studies. </p>
               
            </li>
            <li>
               
               <p class="para_item">After this, you run experiments, i.e., execute simulation runs, within the simulation model. This will produce a number of results, such as how often machines fail, how often they are blocked, which set-up times accrue for the individual types of station, which utilization the machines have, etc. </p>
               
            </li>
            <li>
               
               <p class="para_item">The next step will be to interpret the data the simulation runs produce. </p>
               
            </li>
            <li>
               
               <p class="para_item">Finally, management will use the results as a base for its decisions about optimizing the real plant. </p>
               
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p class="para_topic">Developing your simulation model is a cyclical and evolutionary process. You will start out with a first draft of your model and then refine and modify it to make use of the intermediary results the simulation runs provide. Eventually, after several cycles, you will arrive at your final model. </p>
         <p class="para_topic">As a simulation expert, you must never loose sight of these questions:</p>
