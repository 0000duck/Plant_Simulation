This registers all <em> GA-tables</em> with the <em>GAWizard</em>. Define a <em>Method</em> as the configuration method, The attribute <em>individual</em> designates the table of the individual that is to be evaluated and that the genetic algorithm created. The first line of the source code shows how you can access the chromosomes of the individual. With the configuration method you can transmit all properties of the chromosomes to your simulation model. The result of the method is true when a parametrization can be executed with the values of the individual. When the parametrization fails, the respective individual will be assigned a bad fitness value, a so-called penalty value. The penalty value for unrealizable individuals is the attribute <em>penaltyValue</em> of the <em>GAWizard</em>. To change the value of this attribute, select the <em> GAWizard</em> in the <em> Frame</em>, into which you inserted it, and press the <b class="uiTerm">F8</b> key.
