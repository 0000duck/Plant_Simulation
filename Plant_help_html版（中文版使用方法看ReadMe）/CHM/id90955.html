         <p class="para_topic"> If a multi-processor computer is available for distributed simulations, you can use this computer multiple times as your simulation computer. The <em> ExperimentManager</em> recognizes a computer with several cores. Select the check boxes Distributed simulation in both dialogs as shown below to use distributed simulations. If you did not enter any simulation computers yet and you then select the check box, the <em> ExperimentManager</em> executes distributed simulations according to the number of cores. In this case the table of the simulation computers shows localhost(n). Then number n, designating the number of cores, does not show the actual number of used cores though. This ensures that distributed simulations with this model on another computer uses then number of available cores.
