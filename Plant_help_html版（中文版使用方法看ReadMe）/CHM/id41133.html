         <p class="para_topic"> Enter the priority. <em> Plant Simulation</em> adds the priority of a product to the production order when a new order arrives at the object of type <em> Process_indexed</em>. All production orders in the order list are sorted according to the priority and the point in time at which the order arrives. This way you can define high priority products which have to be processed before all other products. The higher the number you enter the higher the priority.
