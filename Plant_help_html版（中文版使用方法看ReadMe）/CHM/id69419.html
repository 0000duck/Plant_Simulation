         <p class="para_topic">You will create your simulation model by inserting instances of the built-in objects and of objects you yourself or a colleague designed, the so-called user-defined or application objects, from the <em>Class Library</em> into the object <em>Frame</em> in the folder <b class="uiTerm">Models</b>. By modeling application objects you can develop libraries that meet the modeling requirements of your company. The most important built-in objects are: the <em>Frame</em>, the active and the passive material flow objects, the mobile objects (MUs), the <em>Method</em> object, lists and tables, and the <em>EventController</em>.

               <p class="para_item">By inserting <em>Frames</em> into <em>Frames</em> you create a randomly nested <b class="uiTerm">hierarchy</b> of models.

               <p class="para_item">You can derive or duplicate each object and re-use it as often as required, which introduces an important time-saving key feature of <em>Plant Simulation</em>, namely <b class="uiTerm">inheritance</b>: A derived object, i.e., a child object, retains a controllable link to the template object, i.e., the parent object. In many cases the immense advantage of inheritance regarding productivity and the low number of errors only becomes clear at a later point in time, when you actively work with your simulation models. Naturally you can also turn inheritance for individual features off, by clicking the inheritance button, so that it looks like this <img align="bottom" src="../graphics/nonLocalized/plant_sim_help/icons/duplicates3/inheritanceAus_dup1.gif" border="0">.

The <em>Method</em> also provides a <em>Debugger</em> to locate errors and allow you to correct faulty code.
