In a simulation study you will consider how certain model parameters as input values influence result values as output values.</p>
         <p class="para_topic">You might, for example, execute a number of simulation experiments with the <a class="links" href="id53178.html">ExperimentManager</a>

               <p class="para_item">When you re-created an existing plant, you will compare the data you collected on the shop floor with the results of the simulation run. </p>
               
               <p class="para_item">When your model contains random components, you will have to investigate how reliable the data resulting from the simulation runs is. This is especially important for data you use for drawing conclusions about the plant you modeled. Make sure to assign different seed values to the different random components of the random number streams. To consider how the random components statistically influence the results the <em>ExperimentManager</em> will change the seeds of the corresponding random number streams for each set of input values. This way you arrive at a set of observations for the output values under consideration.
               </p>
               
               <p class="para_item">For this reason the <em>ExperimentManager</em> generates a statistical evaluation for each set of input values you enter. More detailed, for each output value and for fixed input values you will receive a confidence interval and a min-max interval with a desired level of confidence.
               </p>
               
               <p class="para_item">A confidence interval, which results from the observations, is an interval of numbers that contains the true mean value of the random number with the confidence level which you entered. The mean value of a random component of the simulation model is unknown, and it cannot be measured exactly, as the simulation runs only provide a finite number of realizations of the corresponding random output values.</p>
               
               <p class="para_item">To statistically hedge the resulting data for random data, you not only average out the results of the different simulation experiments, but you also have to decide if the data allows to draw conclusions about the simulated system, despite of fluctuations of the resulting data. </p>
               
               <p class="para_item">Be aware that one cannot draw conclusions with absolute safety. One can only make statements about a system with random components with a confidence level (level of significance) you define. Compare the chapter about confidence intervals in the documentation that comes with the library <em>DataFit</em>.
