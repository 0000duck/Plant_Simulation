         <p class="para_topic">Whenever you import graphics, it is useful to optimize them. This is not because the graphics you import are badly designed, but because they are typically designed for another kind of use in the originating program. The engineer who designs a component, such as an engine, will naturally include every detail of that engine in the graphic that he creates, because it is imperative to provide these details for producing the engine. </p>
         <p class="para_topic">For us as <em>3D</em> users these details of the engine are of no interest at all. Our main concern is that the simulation runs fast and that the animation looks good and runs smoothly.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">We therefore advise to optimize every graphic you import. Do this as soon as possible, but not before you extracted all the structural information from the graphic that you need, compare <a class="links" href="id20438.html">Creating an Animatable Object</a>.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">Before you can do this, you have to make an animatable object from the graphic, compare <a class="links" href="id93666.html">Make Animatable Object</a>.
