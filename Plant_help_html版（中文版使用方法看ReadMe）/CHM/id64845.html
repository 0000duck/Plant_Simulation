Then, the MU is deleted in the <em>Drain</em>, which naturally also deletes its <em>user-defined attributes</em>. Thereupon the <em> Method</em> is deleted from the list of suspended methods and method execution is terminated, i.e., the instructions after the <em>waituntil instruction</em> will not be executed. If the <em> attribute method</em> was called from another <em> Method</em>, execution of this <em>Method</em> will be continued. When the <em>attribute method</em> had a return value, the value, which the implicitly existing local variable <em>result</em> had at this point in time, will be returned to the calling <em>Method</em>.

Both the execution of the <em>attribute method</em> and of the <em>Method</em> called by it are terminated immediately.
