The rotation is stored in the attribute ObjectAngle and mirroring is stored in the attribute ObjectMirrored.

It now also accepts material flow objects other than objects of type <em>Track</em>. In previous versions these objects were allowed as destination of the route, but not as objects along the way. When assigning a route, which contains such objects with <em>setRoute</em>, then the <em>Transporter</em> passes these objects on its way to the destination. While automatically computing a route, <em>Plant Simulation</em> only takes <em>Tracks</em> and <em>TwoLaneTracks</em> into consideration.

These cannot be called with an index for the successor any longer.

When you change the direction of movement by changing the setting <a class="links" href="id86771.html">Backwards</a> of a <em>Transporter</em>, now the <em> Transporter</em> immediately starts moving. In previous versions you had to make the <em> Transporter</em> start moving again by entering <code>Stopped := false</code>. As a result of this change you may have to adjust your model by <b class="uiTerm">Stopping</b> the <em>Transporter</em> before changing the state of <b class="uiTerm">Backwards</b>.
