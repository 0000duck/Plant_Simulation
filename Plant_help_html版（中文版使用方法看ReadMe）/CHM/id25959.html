         <p class="para_topicComponent">To prevent that objects, which are located within the locked library, can be opened interactively, select this. You can still open instances of these objects, which are inserted in <em>Frames</em> located outside of the library as you normally would.
         </p>
         
         <p class="para_topicComponent">When you develop a library and pass it on and when you want to provide newer versions of the library later on, you should, as a rule, lock the library. This prevents users from inadvertently changing the library. When the user then updates the simulation model with a newer version of the library later on, these changes would be overwritten with the settings of the updated library.</p>
         
         <p class="para_topicComponent">When you select <b class="uiTerm">Lock library</b>, <em>Plant Simulation</em> opens a dialog into which you can enter a <b class="uiTerm">password</b>. When you do not enter a password, the library can be unlocked again at any time. When you assign a password, the library can only be unlocked after entering the correct password. This is helpful when you not only want to prevent inadvertent but also deliberate changes to the library.
         </p>
         
         <p class="para_topicComponent">Note that a locked library can still be changed via information flow. This ensures that a locked library behaves the same as an unlocked library. Therefore locking a library does not completely prevent inadvertent changes.</p>

To protect your know-how, you can encrypt your methods. In addition you can reliably prevent an object and all of its instances from being opened by entering an encrypted user-defined method attribute as the <b class="uiTerm">Open control</b> of an object. Then, only the encrypted <b class="uiTerm">Open control</b> can open the object.
