      <div class="contentType_"><span id="ndxgenid_PlantSimulationENU_668"></span><p class="para_topic">On first sight it seems to be impossible to simulate random processes with a computer, as a computer computes the numbers according to fixed stipulated calculation rules. A computer cannot create a truly random sequence of numbers. A computer-generated sequence of numbers can only approximately have the properties of random numbers. This is why they are called <b class="uiTerm">pseudo random numbers</b>. The sequence of numbers that a computer creates is called random number stream. The computer computes the following number starting from a random number. The algorithm for creating random numbers starts out with the so-called <b class="uiTerm">seed values</b> and can generate any number of values from them. By using different seed values you can model several random processes that are independent of each other. 
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">For creating a random number it oftentimes suffices to create a uniformly distributed random number located in the interval between 0 and 1 (0,1). A random number is uniformly distributed, when the probability for an interval only depends on its length, and not from it position on the line of numbers. Using a uniformly distributed random number the computer can, for example, algorithmically create a normally distributed random number with a given mean value and standard deviation.</p>
         <p class="para_topic">A uniformly distributed pseudo random number has to meet a number of requirements:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               
               <p class="para_item">The arrangement of the random numbers shows no typical characteristics, i.e., the algebraic signs of consecutive random numbers do not display any typical patterns. </p>
               
            </li>
            <li>
               
               <p class="para_item">The algorithm for creating random numbers has to become periodic, as the computer only has a finite number of states. For this reason the period length has to be as large as possible.</p>
               
            </li>
            <li>
               
               <p class="para_item">Starting from the given seed values a large number of stochastically independent random numbers has to be available for the simulation. </p>

               <p class="para_item">The random processes of a simulation have to be reproducible to be able to use certain statistic methods, such as the variance reduction.</p>
