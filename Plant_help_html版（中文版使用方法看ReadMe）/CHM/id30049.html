         <p class="para_topic">When you do not use a <a class="links" href="id30049.html">FootPath</a>, <em>Plant Simulation</em> transports the <em>Worker</em> directly to the <em>Workplace</em>. Here the <em>Worker</em> functions as an <a class="links" href="id93899.html">Exporter</a> with a capacity of 1. When you want to model and simulate walking distances between the <em>WorkerPool</em> and work stations or between work stations, use the <em>FootPath</em>. <em>Plant Simulation</em> animates the <em> Workers</em> on the <em>FootPath</em>, when they move to the stations or in between the stations. 
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">You can link several <em>FootPaths</em> with <em>Connectors</em> to create a network of <em>FootPaths</em>. The <em>Worker</em> moves within this network from his <em>WorkerPool</em> to the <em>Workplace</em>. Provided the <em>WorkerPool</em> and the <em>Workplace</em> are connected to the same network of <em>FootPaths</em>, the <em>Worker</em> moves from the <em>WorkerPool</em> to the <em>Workplace</em> and back on the shortest possible route.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">A network of <em>FootPaths</em> consists of all <em>FootPaths</em> that are joined with <em> Connectors</em>, as well as the <em> WorkerPools</em> and the <em>Workplaces</em> that are joined with one of these <em>FootPaths</em> with a <em> Connector</em>.

         <p class="para_topic">The time it takes the <em>Worker</em> to move from his <em>WorkerPool</em> to the <em>Workplace</em> depends on his <a class="links" href="id27582.html">Speed</a> and the combined <a class="links" href="id88471.html">Lengths</a> of the <em>FootPaths</em> he covers to reach his destination. <em>Plant Simulation</em> recognizes on which <em>FootPaths</em> the <em>Worker</em> moves, when he exits a <em>FootPath</em> at another end than the one at which he entered it. When the <em>Worker</em> does not move to his destination on a <em>FootPath</em> or when he is transported directly to his destination, he does not consume any time at all.

         <p class="para_topic">The <em> Workers</em> are created in the <a class="links" href="id13713.html">WorkerPool</a> and they stay there, when they do not work and are waiting for an order.
