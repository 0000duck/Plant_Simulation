      <div class="contentType_"><span id="ndxgenid_PlantSimulationENU_646"></span><p class="para_topic">When you model your plant you will, at one point, also face the task of placing parts into stock and removing them from stock. To model a warehouse, you will use the object <a class="links" href="id54257.html">Store</a>
            <img align="bottom" src="../graphics/nonLocalized/plant_sim_help/icons/icons/storeSm.gif" border="0">. The parts remain in the <em>Store</em> until you remove them with a <em>Method</em>. The <em>Store</em> accepts parts as long as storage places are available. The incoming <em>part</em> triggers a sensor, when it enters the <em>Store</em>. The sensor then calls an <b class="uiTerm">entrance control</b>, i.e., a <em>Method</em> object, that determines the storage place onto which the <em>Store</em> deposits the <em>part</em>. The <b class="uiTerm">entrance control</b> can, for example, update the inventory list or execute any other action which you program. If you do not use an <b class="uiTerm">entrance control</b>, the <em>Store</em> deposits the <em>part</em> into the first free storage place in the net of coordinates of the storage places. In our sample model the material flow is controlled by the method <em>PlaceInStock</em>, which we use as the <b class="uiTerm">entrance control</b> of the warehouse, and by the method <em>RemoveFromStock</em>, which we use as the <b class="uiTerm">exit control</b> of the station <em>RetrieveFromStore</em>.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">As parts occasionally have to be reworked, we want to change the original order of parts, which are placed into stock, and we then want to re-establish the original order when we remove them from stock. We do this in the station <em>MixOrders</em> located directly before our <em>Store</em>. 
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">We have to set the size of the <em>Store</em> according to the degree of change of the sequence to prevent it from overflowing. To accomplish this two events are essential: First an additional part arrives at the <em>Store</em> and second a part is removed from the <em>Store</em>. When the <em>Store</em> is full, it does not accept any additional parts. We therefore have to increase the size of the <em>Store</em> in the <b class="uiTerm">entrance control</b> of the <em>Store</em> is full. Each part that is placed into stock and that is removed from stock must be registered on the table file <em>InventoryTable</em>. To manage the inventory and to remove parts from stock, we program the control <em>AttemptToRemoveNextPart</em>, which is called by the methods <em>PlaceInStock</em> and <em>RemoveFromStock</em>. This method checks whether the next removing action is possible so that the original order of the parts can be re-established so that the production process can be maintained without a shortage of parts. 
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">In the <em>reset method</em> we delete the contents of the <em>InventoryTable</em> and reset the counter of the <em>variable</em><em>NextNumber</em> to 1.
         </p>
         <p class="para_topic">You can insert the <em>Store</em> into your simulation model from the folder <b class="uiTerm">Materialflow</b> in the <em>Class Library</em> or from the toolbar <b class="uiTerm">Materialflow</b> in the <em>Toolbox</em>.
