You will start out with a first draft of your model and then refine and modify it to make use of the intermediary results the simulation runs provide. Eventually, after several cycles, you will arrive at your final model. </p>
         <p class="para_topic">Before you start implementing your simulation project, you will, more or less, proceed like this. You will: </p>

               <p class="para_item"><b class="uiTerm">Describe the project.</b></p>
               
               <p class="para_item">Determine the goals, so that the purpose of the simulation project becomes clear. Why are you examining a problem? Which questions do you want answered? Put the definition of the project in writing and consult it repeatedly during the course of the project, as the purpose of the simulation study determines the efforts to be made. </p>

               <p class="para_item">Create a concept of your model, with its initial values, its model items, variables, logic of proceeding and a preliminary description of the simulation experiments. Which parameters do you have to change, which data do you have to collect and how do you interpret this data? Make a list of all functional units that the installation you are modeling will contain. Think about which functional units have identical or similar functionality. Combine them and derive a list of application objects you and your colleagues have to create. Consider re-using existing objects. Specify and plan the remaining objects on paper. Define and describe the interfaces for material and information flow. Outline <em>reset</em> and <em>init</em><em>methods</em>.

               <p class="para_item">Ensure early on that the data you need to run the simulation experiments is going to be available. Frequently a lot of time and effort is involved to acquire the data. Make sure that you have the name of a person who responsible for acquiring the data from your client, which may, for example, be another department of your company. </p>

               <p class="para_item">Build a first version of the simulation model in its simplest, most basic form. Build the application objects you need and test them one by one. After you are sure that all objects work the way they are supposed to do, put together the overall model. Document the model in a clearly arranged manner, as six months or a year from the time you modeled you might not remember how you accomplished a certain task or why you solved a specific problem the way you did. </p>

               <p class="para_item">After you are finished building the simulation model, you have to verify it, i.e., check if the components you modeled perform the tasks you programmed them to do. Test each and every object you created. Check for the correct functioning and for concurrence with the specifications. Test the objects in combination with other objects and then in the overall model. Make sure that all parameters are set to the correct values. Once you have verified the model, check it for its validity: Make sure the functionality of the model is as expected and conforms to the functionality of the planned or real plant and see if the results are plausible and credible. Make an estimate of the most important results and compare them with the results of the simulation. Introduce your model to a production or planning expert and discuss the results, the proceedings and your modeling approach with him. </p>

               <p class="para_item">Once you are finished with the simulation project, update the notes you made while modeling to create the final documentation of the entire simulation project. This will help you, when you have to update or extend your simulation model or any of its components. Executing simulation experiments is a cyclical and evolutionary process. You will modify and improve your initial simulation model a number of times as you incorporate new insights from previous simulation runs. Thus you will arrive at your final simulation model after several cycles after continuously changing your initial draft of your simulation model.</p>
